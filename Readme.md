I built this SQL share trading project to practice and strengthen my foundational database skills.
Using a single transactions table, I worked through real business questions step by step: creating the schema, inserting sample data, making structural tweaks, and writing essential queries.

This project is designed for anyone learning SQL—whether you’re just starting or reviewing the basics. The queries and scripts here are simple, clear, and meant to be practical examples for self-study or quick reference.


📁 Project Structure

- setup_scripts/  –  Table creation, insertion, and alterations
- queries/        –  All SQL queries
- docs/           –  Screenshots and outputs
- README.md       –  Project summary

## 📘 What I Tried Out

- Built the table and set up all columns from scratch
- Added realistic (but simple) sample share trading data
- Practiced changing the table structure—like adding or removing columns
- Wrote easy-to-follow SELECT queries to answer common trading questions
- Included screenshots so you can see exactly what results I got

## 📜 SQL Queries

1. Query_1.sql – Show all transactions
2. Query_2.sql – Count total number of transactions
3. Query_3.sql – List all unique stock symbols
4. Query_4.sql – All trades where broker is Zerodha
5. Query_5.sql – List all transactions, highest to lowest price per share
6. Query_6.sql – Calculate total price for each transaction
7. Query_7.sql – Total shares purchased for each stock symbol
8. Query_8.sql – Highest price per share in all transactions
9. Query_9.sql – Mark each transaction as 'High Value' if price_per_share > 2000, else 'Normal'
10. Query_10.sql – Show all transactions with NULL values replaced by defaults

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Run scripts from `setup_scripts/` to create and prepare the table.
2. Use the queries in `queries/` to analyze the data.
3. Check the `docs/` folder for screenshots and reference outputs.
